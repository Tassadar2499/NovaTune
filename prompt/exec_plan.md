Read the implementation plan. Analyze all stages and identify which ones have no dependencies on each other and can be implemented in parallel. For each independent stage, use the Task tool to spawn a sub-agent with these instructions: (1) create a git branch named stage-N, (2) implement all files for that stage, (3) run 'dotnet build' and fix any errors, (4) run all relevant unit tests and fix failures, (5) report back with files changed and test results. After all parallel tasks complete, integrate the branches sequentially, running the full test suite after each merge. Present a final summary of all changes, test results, and any conflicts resolved.
